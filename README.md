## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Due to Puch.ai’s context window limits:

* Large files or large repos may not be fully processed.
* Best suited for:

  * Single-file edits
  * Lightweight commits
  * Small to mid-sized repositories

For most side projects, open source work, and quick fixes — it’s more than enough.

Modern developers juggle dozens of repos and constant context switching. This tool removes the friction — so you can:

* File and resolve issues in seconds
* Pull up files instantly
* Commit and open PRs without opening your IDE

Whether you're managing open-source contributions, shipping side projects, or fighting fires in prod, this assistant keeps you fast, focused, and in flow.
